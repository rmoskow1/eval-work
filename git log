Git logs allow you to review and read a history of everything that happens to a repository.
A Git log is a running record of commits. A full log has the following pieces:

A commit hash (SHA1 40 character checksum of the commits contents). Because it is generated based on the commit contents it is unique.
Commit Author metadata: The name and email address of the author of the commit.
Commit Date metadata: A date timestamp for the time of the commit
Commit title/message: The overview of the commit as written in the commit message.
