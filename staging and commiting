a commit in Github is 2 steps - staging and the actual commiting
sources: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/119782/what-does-stage-mean-in-git
in staging, Git knows the changes that are about to take place, but no actual change has occured in the repo. When you commit, that's when the actual changes happen in the repo
staging is an "intermediate" stage

note: partial commits are possible!
