a commit in Github is 2 steps - staging and the actual commiting
sources: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/119782/what-does-stage-mean-in-git
in staging, Git knows the changes that are about to take place, but no actual change has occured in the repo. When you commit, that's when the actual changes happen in the repo
staging is an "intermediate" stage. Commiting is the final stage - going straight into the repo.

you could say staging is when  you've marked a file to go into your next commit

note: partial commits are possible! You could select just one line and choose to commit
