git diff <commit-name>^..<commit-name> : shows the differnces between 2 commits (i.e. all the differences that have occured between one snapshot in time and another)
source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3368590/show-diff-between-commits


Supposedly this lets you see the differnces between 2 commits without the commits between.
you can simply pass the 2 commits to git diff like :

-> git diff 0da94be  59ff30c > my.patch
-> git apply my.patch

Pinchas and I are still a little confused on this.
