https://imagej.net/Git_Conflicts#Merge_conflicts

they occur when your current branch and the branch you want to merge into the current branch have diverged. 
That is, you have commits in your current branch which are not in the other branch, and vice versa.
your base is the current latest common commit. merge will compare the latest commit from eahc branch after the base and
resolve all non-conflicting commits. it then marks all the conflicts for you to manually resolve
