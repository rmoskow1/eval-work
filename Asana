Everybody within your company is in the Asana - it's a means of communicating work amonst your team. 

Tasks:
- you add tasks by the little orange "+" sign on the top - tasks can be assigned to specific people or not. You can also create subtasks 
within the tasks, and check off subtasks as you go. 
- you can organize tasks into PROJECTS - tasks related to a specific initiative or goal (existing projects
are listed on the sidebar -- you can use the dropdown to see who's in them, and join a project by clicking the plus sign 
on that project name)
- you can start your own project using the plus sign on top (same button for starting a task).
- you can drag and drop tasks into your project - you can also add due dates and project members
- you can add followers to tasks, comment on tasks, @mention people in tasks
- you can add the same tasks to multiple projects, so that everyone can see the progress
- you can mark a task as waiting on another task (this way - if the one you're waiting for is finished, you'll
get a notification that you can start yours)

inbox - will have notifications about projects for you - a little orange dot tells you there are new messages
there's an asana chrome extension available
you can use the "progress" button to show how a project is going
there's a calendar you can use for each project, and a "files" button to attach appropriate files for the project
Other apps:
