Your work isn't all done on github.com! Actual coding is done on a "remote branch" - you can copy the master to your own computer and branch from there. 
From your computer, you work on your branch remotely, not actually effecting anything found online. 
When you're confident in your remote branch, THEN you can push it online - merging the changes you made remotely to the master branch. 

Things to note:
By definition, the work you do remotely is not accessable to other people - what happens on your computer stays on your computer...that is, until you push it online. 
We've been using GitHub desktop - anything we do is remote until we create a pull request. This can be approved online or on the app. 

You can think of them as pointers to the current state of the branches in your remote repo. May or may not match
