Your work isn't all done on github.com! Actual coding is done on a local branch - you can copy the master to your own computer and branch from there. 
From your computer, you work on your branch localy, not actually effecting anything found online. Online is where the "remote" branches are. 
When you're confident in your local branch, THEN you can push it online - merging the changes you made localy to the remote master branch. 

Things to note:
By definition, the work you do locally is not accessable to other people - what happens on your computer stays on your computer...that is, until you push it online - to the remote. 
We've been using GitHub desktop - anything we do is local until we create a pull request. This can be approved online or on the app - then it goes remote

You can think of them as pointers to the current state of the branches in your remote repo. May or may not match the local branches you have on your computer with the same name. Syncing on the Github desktop makes your local branch match the remote branch.
