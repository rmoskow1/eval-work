You can take a series of commits and squash them down into a single commit with the interactive rebasing tool. This is a way of editing your commit history. 
On the command line - "squash" means use this commit and the previous one - but all as one commit.
git rebase -i [parent of the last commit]

Github desktop may not actually support interactive rebasing. That needs to be done from the command line..
