force push allows you to push from the local without regard for changes in the remote 
as the thing you're pushing will override the remote repo receiving the push.
this effectively changes the history and makeup of the remote repo to 
perfectly mimic your local repo even if the two had diverged.
this however is dangerous in a shared repo because someone may have pulled from the remote repo before you force pushed, 
changing the history, and may therefore be working with improper data, leading to problems in their work and error when they 
try to push.
