If I'm merging file A to file B (file A is the base) then the selecting commits of file B will go to file A. 
I think of a merge as a combination - but not always an equal combination. (not neccesarily are all commits of B joing A, or vice versa)


Types of merging:
- the default merge pull request on Github --- here, all commits from the feature branch (the one with the different commits) will be added to the base branch in a commit. 
- squash merge commits -- all the commits from the pull request are "squashed" into one commit. Squashing would be really - say i commit and then see a bug
fast forward versus not fast forward -- these are the different types of merges


**rebase isn't really a merge. Squash  is a rebase

question: Is merging always a pull request?
