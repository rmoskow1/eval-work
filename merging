If I'm merging file A to file B (file A is the base) then the selecting commits of file B will go to file A. 
I think of a merge as a combination - but not always an equal combination. (not neccesarily are all commits of B joing A, or vice versa)


Types of merging:
- in a typical merge -- there's the base branch and the feature branch. The base branch (or master branch really) has continued since the feature branch was created. We need a merge commit to combine the new commits in the feature branch back to the base branch.
- fast forward merge -- here, the master branch has not diverged since the feature branch was created! So instead of a new commit, the master will just point to the last commit of the feautre branch.

question: Is merging always a pull request?
