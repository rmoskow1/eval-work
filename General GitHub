GitHub is a tool for collaborative coding. It's a way of giving teammates access to your own work, and giving you access to there's. 
There's a "master branch" - final products of your work. When code is in the master branch, the assumption is that everyone knows and approves
of this code - and can feel confident working off of it. And of course, there's lots of other branches that diverge from the master branch. 

People work locally (on their own computers) by fetching from branches online, or starting a new one. Locally, changes/edits can be made. 
Then, when confident in your code, you can push from the local branch to the remote branch (put your own local work online). Teammates can review it from there-
if you want it in the master branch, you can make a pull request -- a request saying, I want the additions that I made in my branch to be added to the master branch. 

Github is a great system of checks and balances -- changes you make locally won't have any effect until you push them remotely...and your branches can't be merged to the master
until the pull request is apporved. If conflicts exist when you try to merge branches, git forces you to take a look at them yourself, and resolve conflicts.
