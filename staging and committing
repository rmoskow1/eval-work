staging allows you to decide which files and pieces of code will be included in your next commit.
you can choose to partially stage parts of files so that the file is only changed partially by the commit.
Commiting allows you to take changes made in a text editor and saved on your computer and place the locally into your repo.
Desktop github also allows you to partially commit
