git checkout <commit>  -- this checks out the particular commit. Checkout is READ ONLY - no actual changes. 
But you do make changes if you do git checkout <commit> <file>  : this can change the file back to the previous state, the state of the commit.

If you want to actually make changes, you could make a branch while you're there:
git checkout -b branch-name <commit>
*note: to make a new branch and switch to it, you can do "git checkout -b branch-name" for shorthand. 

git revert will make changes as well, "undoing" previous commits that you made.
